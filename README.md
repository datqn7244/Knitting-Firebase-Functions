# Knitting-Firebase-Functions
Firebase functions for knitting project

Include all RestAPI route for create, read, edit, delete projects and parts.
This project use Firebase functions, Express and Cloud Firestore to store the data. I used this project to learn typescript and revise my express knowledge cause I only used PHP in my internship and haven't use NodeJs and ReactJS in a while.
